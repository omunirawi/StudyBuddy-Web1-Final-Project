# SPA StudyBuddy (Web 1 Final Project)

A simple single-page app (SPA) to help students manage **Tasks**, track **Weekly Habits**, and save **Study Resources**.

## Features
- SPA navigation (no page reload)
- Dashboard summary (soon due tasks, completed tasks, habit progress, progress bar)
- Tasks CRUD (add, edit, delete with confirmation, complete/uncomplete)
- Filter (All / Active / Completed), filter by Category, sort (Due date / Priority)
- Habits weekly tracker (goal 1–7 days, toggle daily progress)
- Resources loaded from `resources.json` using `fetch()` with Loading / Error states
- Favorites (star) saved in localStorage
- Settings: theme toggle (light/dark) + reset data

## How to run
1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Run with **Live Server** (recommended) by opening `index.html`
3. Or just open `index.html` in your browser
